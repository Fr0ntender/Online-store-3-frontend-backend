# Test application - Part of the online store - Phase 3 / client.

This application is a small part of the functionality of an online store with a simplified admin control panel, which can be entered using the “test” as a username and password.
The application is intended to demonstrate the code.

Server code is available here - https://github.com/Frost0x/Online-store_Phase2_server

To create the client, I used: React / React-Apollo / Redux / Styled Components.

To create the server, I used: Node / GraphQL / Express / Mongoose. 

Database: MongoDB.

### Runs the app in the development mode. 

`yarn start`

### Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
