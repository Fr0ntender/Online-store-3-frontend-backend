# Test application - Part of the online store - Phase 2 / client.

This application is a small part of the functionality of an online store with a simplified admin control panel, which can be entered using the “test” as a username and password.
The application is intended to demonstrate the code.

To create the client, I used: React / Redux / Styled Components.

To create the server, I used: Node / Express / Mongoose. 

Database: MongoDB.
