# Test application - part of the online store - Phase 2 / server.

This application is a small part of the functionality of an online store with a simplified admin control panel, which can be entered using the “test” as a username and password.
The application is intended to demonstrate the code.

The server is designed to process client requests and store information in a database.
The code is written very simply only to support the functionality of the client, in the future, the code will be supplemented.

Client code is available here - https://github.com/Frost0x/Online-store_Phase2_client

To create the client, I used: React / Redux / Styled Components.

To create the server, I used: Node / Express / Mongoose. 

Database: MongoDB.

For deployment, I used: AWS ES2 / Ubuntu / Docker-Compose.

The application is available at https://frost0x.ru
